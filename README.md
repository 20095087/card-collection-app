# card-collection-app

This application will allow the users to create albums where cards will be stored.
These cards will be added in by the user too.
The user will be able to update and delete either an album or card(s) in the album of choice.

Ideally files will automatically load when the app starts and files will save when the app is closed.

This app is part of my Software Development Tools assignment 3.
